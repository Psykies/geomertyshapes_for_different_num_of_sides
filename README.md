# Geometric Shape Drawer

This Python program allows users to draw geometric shapes using the turtle module based on the number of sides they specify.

## Features

- Draws a circle for 0 sides.
- Draws a dot for 1 side.
- Draws a straight line for 2 sides.
- Draws a polygon with the specified number of sides for 3 or more sides.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   https://github.com/Psykies/geomertyshapes_for_different_num_of_sides.git
   ```

3. Enter the number of sides for the geometric shape when prompted.
4. Watch as the program draws the shape using the turtle module!

This will draw a pentagon with equal side lengths.

## Special Cases

- For 0 sides: Draws a circle with a radius of 100 units.
- For 1 side: Draws a dot with a diameter of 20 units.
- For 2 sides: Draws a straight line of length 200 units.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in standard Python distribution)
